-----------
* Update code to ImpressCMS 1.3/2.0 spec. The module is no longer compatible with the 1.2 series.
* Fix warning on new.php when programme doesn't have cover art.
* Fix display of streaming icon on programmes that don't have any content.

* Display module name when breadcrumb disabled.
* Fix new releases page to display page title when there are no soundtracks.
* Improve CSS to stop content being pushed down by floating divs (remove clear).
* Fix slow index page load when gzip enabled on ICMS 1.3.2.

Version 1.31
------------

* Revert to use of the theme changer block bugfix.

Version 1.32 (20/2/2013)
------------------------
* Substantially reduce queries and the overall efficiency of the search function.
* Update language files (remove outdated warning about Chrome not displaying xml tree, generalise 
to include video podcasts).
* Fix bug where soundtracks marked offline were still being included in RSS feeds.
* Add inline media support via JW Player.
* Updated the manual.

Version 1.33 (18/7/2013)
-------------------------
* Fix format of URLs in <dc:relation> field of the OAIPMH service.
* Adopt the Sprockets OAIPMH service (deprecate OAIPMH code in Podcast module).
* Remove paragraph tags from template description field, should be entered in description itself.
* Fix bug in search function that was crashing profile views.
* Fix date format in search function.

Version 1.34 (24/7/2013)
------------------------
* Add publisher to searchable fields
* Add selective clearance of cache when a programme or soundtrack is added/edited/deleted.
* Add static 'type' field to identify programmes as "Text" resources.
* Remove use of global $podcastConfig in favour of icms_getConfig() in class files.
* Changed the 'date' field from arbitrary text string to long datetime object, for consistency 
across modules. Note that this will probably mangle existing entries, so they will need to be reset
manually after upgrading to this version (can probably recover from submission_time field or date 
of first soundtrack entered into the programme, if you forget).
* Add support for tagging, including dynamic tagging on blocks (only if Sprockets module installed).
